Finding a job is suitable for a person looking for a job, based on
their job descriptions,: In this paper, we focus on examining person
profile using various deep neural network models including
TextCNN, CNN-LST, TextRNN, and RCNN with various pre-trained
word embeddings in the job data set.We also proposed a simple and
effective ensemble model that combines different deep neural network
models. Our experimental results showed that our proposed
ensemble model had the highest score with an F1 score of 89%.
Furthermore, we analyze these experimental results to understand
this problem in order to find better solutions in the future.
In this work we implement and benchmark various deep neural
network language models to find suitable jobs for a person with a
given skillset. The neural networks include TextCNN, CNN-LST,
TextRNN, and RCNN with various pre-trained word embeddings.
We refine these models using a dataset we collected from German
online job boards. In addition we propose an effective ensemble
model combining the best performing deep learning architectures
for this specific task. Our proposed model performs with a F1-Score
of 89% on the 89-class classification task. Furthermore, we analyze
these experimental results to understand this problem in order to
find better solutions in the future.
